I am one of many people, I think, who do not participate in broad, public internet discussions. For anyone who already experiences marginalization or straight up bigotry in their day-to-day lives, the lack of tools available to protect ourselves makes it that much more difficult to actively decide to participate in a space where we know we’re likely to be harassed and attacked.

That said, outright dismissing all comments sections everywhere leaves a lot to be desired. It leaves those who have spoken up isolated. And it leaves those who leave bigoted or attacking comments without dissent.

A large part of why there are no comment forms on this site is that I did not have the mental capacity to be moderating conversations when I started this site. And knowing what I wanted to post about, I expected at least a few to come. I could not invest the time to protect any community that might build, so I didn’t open the floor.

I hope I get to reassess that in the future and see a different landscape.
